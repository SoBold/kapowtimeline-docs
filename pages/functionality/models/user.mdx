# User Model for Timeline

Namespace: `SoBold\Timeline`

## Class: User

The User class represents a user in the timeline system, mainly focusing on handling user identification.

### Properties

- `public $id` - ID of the user.

### Methods

#### `__construct(int $id = 0)`

Constructs the user model. If no ID is provided, it defaults to either the session's user ID (if set) or 0, indicating an empty model.

- `@param int $id` - The ID of the user.
- `@return array` - Returns an empty model if no ID is set or derived from the session.

#### `initialize(array $obj = [], int $id = 0)`

Initializes the class with the provided object and ID.

- `@param array $obj` - The base object for initialization.
- `@param int $id` - The ID of the user.
- `@return object`

This constructor and initializer are designed to set up a User object based on a given ID, with a fallback to a session-based ID if available.
