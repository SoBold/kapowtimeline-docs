## 1. Introduction
This guide serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working on the WordPress theme, ensuring adherence to best practices in code quality and consistency.

## 2. Packages Used
### 2.1 Husky
Husky is used to manage Git hooks. It ensures that commit messages follow the conventional commits format.

#### Husky Configuration
*Insert Husky configuration details here.*

### 2.2 Prettier
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and re-printing it with its own rules.

#### `.prettierrc.json`
```json
{
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": true
}
```

### 2.3 ESLint
ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.

#### `.eslintrc`
```json

    "env": {
        "browser": true,

}
```

### 2.4 Commitlint
Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.

#### Commitlint Rules
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
- `docs`: Documentation only changes.
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance.

## 3. Theme Structure
### 3.1 Blocks
Blocks are the fundamental building blocks of the theme. Each block resides in `/components/blocks/{blockname}/`.

#### Block Structure
- JavaScript file: Export a default function.
- SCSS file: For styling.
- PHP file: For backend logic.

Blocks should be registered in `_blocks.js`.

### 3.2 Layouts
Layout components like headers and footers are located in `/components/layouts/`.

## 4. Branch Management and Deployment
Our workflow involves two primary branches: `main` and `develop`.

### 4.1 Branches
- **`main`**: This branch is linked to production. All changes pushed to `main` are deployed to the production environment.
- **`develop`**: This branch is for development. It's linked to our development environment. Changes pushed here are deployed to a staging or testing site.

### 4.2 Deployment Process
Both branches are integrated with DeployHQ for automated deployments:
- **Production Deployment**: Changes pushed to the `main` branch automatically trigger a deployment to the production environment.
- **Development Deployment**: Changes pushed to the `develop` branch automatically trigger a deployment to the development environment.

### 4.3 Workflow Recommendations
- Always push changes to the `develop` branch first.
- After thorough testing and review in the development environment, create a pull request (PR) to merge changes into the `main` branch.
- This approach ensures that the `main` branch remains stable and that all new changes are properly tested before reaching production.
